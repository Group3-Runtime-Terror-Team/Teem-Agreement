# Git Process

**Components on GitHub:**
Our project components, including source code, documentation, and assets, reside on GitHub, ensuring centralized version control and collaboration.

**Sharing the Repository:**
The team leader will create a GitHub organization, set up the repository, and invite team members as collaborators. Each member will have appropriate permissions for seamless contribution and branch management.

**Git Flow:**
We adopt the feature branch workflow:

- **Branch Creation:** Team members create branches from the sub-main development branch, naming them after themselves.
- **Development:** Incremental commits document progress on respective branches, maintaining a well-documented history of changes.
- **Pull Requests (PR):** Completed features are merged into the sub-main development branch through pull requests, fostering collaboration and ensuring code quality.
